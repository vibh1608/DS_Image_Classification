# DS_Image_Classification

Image Classification
In this project, I have classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects.I have preprocessed the images, then trained a convolutional neural network on all the samples.
The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded.
<b>Test Accuracy - 68.87 %</b>
